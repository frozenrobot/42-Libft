The first project in the 42 Core Curriculum.

The objective of this project was to recode some standard and additional functions in C.
At 42, the use of external libraries is kept to a minimum, and so we are encouraged to code the functinos we need to use ourselves.
Libft serves as our self-created library of functions to use in subsequent projects.
